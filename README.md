# BresserWeatherSensorLW

Bresser 868 MHz Weather Sensor Radio Receiver based on ESP32/RP2040 and SX1262/SX1276 &mdash; sends data to a LoRaWAN Network

This is a remake of [BresserWeatherSensorTTN](https://github.com/matthias-bs/BresserWeatherSensorTTN) based on [RadioLib](https://github.com/jgromes/RadioLib) instead of [MCCI Arduino LoRaWAN Library](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lorawan) for LoRaWAN communication.

This is early stage of development - stay tuned.
